# BT Real Estate

## Description

This is the BT Real Estate project from Brad Traversy's 2019 Python Django Dev to Deployment course.

I made the following modifications:

- Outsourced CSS & JS libraries from CDNs instead of bundling them locally

- Added requirements.txt

- Moved the Breadcrumb into a Partial

- Some other minor modifications
