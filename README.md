# BT Real Estate

## Description

This is the BT Real Estate project from Brad Traversy's 2019 Python Django Dev to Deployment course.

I made the following modifications:

- Third party resources retrieved from CDNs instead of locally bundled

- Redirect staff members to admin area after logging in through user-facing login page

- Added a nav link to the admin area that only appears when a staff member is logged in

- Added a favicon

- Other minor modifications

- Bug fixes
